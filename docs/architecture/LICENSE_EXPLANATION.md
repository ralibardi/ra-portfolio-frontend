# License Explanation

## Why This License?

This portfolio project uses a **proprietary license** rather than an open-source license for the following reasons:

### 🎯 Purpose
This is a **personal portfolio** designed to showcase my unique skills, design aesthetic, and professional capabilities. It's not a template or framework meant for general use.

### ✅ What You CAN Do
- **View the code** - Employers, recruiters, and collaborators can review my work
- **Learn from it** - Use it as a reference for educational purposes
- **Discuss it** - Reference the code in technical interviews or discussions
- **Evaluate my skills** - Assess my coding abilities and practices

### ❌ What You CANNOT Do
- **Copy or clone** - Don't create your own portfolio using this code
- **Redistribute** - Don't share or publish this code elsewhere
- **Commercial use** - Don't use this code in commercial projects
- **Create derivatives** - Don't modify and redistribute this work

## 💡 The Reasoning

### For Employers/Recruiters
